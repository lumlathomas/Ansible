To create an encrypted YAML file using Ansible Vault, run the following command:

```bash
ansible-vault create secret.yaml
```

You will be prompted to provide a password. Once the password is set, the file will open in the `vi` editor, where you can add your YAML content. Save and exit the editor (:wq!) to complete the process.

After creation, the file is encrypted, and you won’t be able to read or edit it directly without the password. To modify the encrypted YAML file, use the following command:

```bash
ansible-vault edit secret.yaml
```

You will need to enter the password you set earlier to access and edit the file.

If you want to decrypt the file, use:

```bash
ansible-vault decrypt secret.yaml
```

You’ll be prompted to enter the password to decrypt the file.

To encrypt the file again for security, run:

```bash
ansible-vault encrypt secret.yaml
```

This ensures the file remains secure and protected.
